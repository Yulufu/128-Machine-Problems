# CS-128 : MP : Hawaiian Words
Background
There are 12 valid characters in the Hawaiian language: a, e, i, o, u, p, k, h, l, m, n, and w. Each Hawaiian word passed into our program must be inspected to ensure that only these characters compose them, because if an invalid character presents, we don’t have a valid Hawaiian word.

The consonants in the Hawaiian language are pronounced similarly to the English versions, though w’s are pronounced with a w or v sound.

Vowel groups are also present in the Hawaiian language. More “complex” words can have many vowels that when grouped together require additional rules. This means we can’t simply replace all a’s with ah, all e’s with eh, etc. We will consider the following simplification of the Hawaiian vowel groups for this assignment:
