# CS-128 : MP : Hawaiian Words
Background
There are 12 valid characters in the Hawaiian language: a, e, i, o, u, p, k, h, l, m, n, and w. Each Hawaiian word passed into our program must be inspected to ensure that only these characters compose them, because if an invalid character presents, we don’t have a valid Hawaiian word.

The consonants in the Hawaiian language are pronounced similarly to the English versions, though w’s are pronounced with a w or v sound.

Consonants
p, k, h, l, m, n	Pronounced like the english versions.
w - start of word	Either pronounced as a w or a v sound. We shall pronounce it as a w sound.
w - after the letter ‘a’	Either pronounced as a w or a v sound. We shall pronounce it as a w sound.
w - after ‘i’ or ‘e’	Pronounced as a v sound.
w - after ‘u’ or ‘o’	Pronounced as a w sound.
The vowels in the Hawaiian language are a, e, i, o, and u.

Vowels
a	sounds like ah. eg. like that in “Austin” (ah-stin)
e	sounds like eh. eg. like that in “egg” (eh-gg)
i	sounds like ee. eg. like that in “bee”
o	sounds like oh. eg. like that in “obey” (oh bay)
u	sounds like oo. eg. like that in “mood” (m oo d)
These rules allow us to create phonetic guides for some simple Hawaiian words. For instance, aloha is pronounced as ah-loh-hah.

Vowel groups are also present in the Hawaiian language. More “complex” words can have many vowels that when grouped together require additional rules. This means we can’t simply replace all a’s with ah, all e’s with eh, etc. We will consider the following simplification of the Hawaiian vowel groups for this assignment:

Vowels groups
ai	sounds like eye. eg. like that in “ice“
ae	sounds like eye. same as ai
ao	sounds like ow. eg. like that in “how”
au	sounds like ow. eg. like that in “house”
ei	sounds like ay. eg. like that in “hay”
eu	sounds like eh-oo.
iu	sounds like ew.
oi	sounds like oy.
ou	sounds like ow.
ui	sounds like ooey. eg. like that in “gooey”
The Hawaiian word keiki means child, with the ei is pronounced as ay; keiki sounds like kay-kee. The island of Maui is pronounced as mow-ee.

In cases where a combination of vowels (e.g., oa) is not represented in the “vowels groups” table, each vowel is pronounced as an individual vowel sounds. Accordingly, oa would be pronounced as oh-ah. Notice that in writing the pronunciation, the placement of the hyphen comes after a vowel or vowel group.
